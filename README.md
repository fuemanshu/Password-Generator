App is at MVP 1.0 phase.
- Accepts User Input, creates and array, generates random characters, and displays it on the application and in the console.


End User Notes
- Characters for random password are in the "availableCharacters" variable in the script in the Index.html file. Make a change to these characters if you want to use different characters. In the future I may add options to include/exlude certain characters.
