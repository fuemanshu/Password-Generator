App is at MVP 1.0
- Accepts User Input, creates an array, generates random password and displays on the application and console.

- Characters for random password are in the "availableCharacters" variable in the script in the Index.html file. Make a change to these characters if you want to use different characters. I plan to add options to include/exlude certain characters based on user need.
